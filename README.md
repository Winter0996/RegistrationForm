# RegistrationForm using WebStorm IDE
This project was a fun way to practice my HTML and CSS skills.  There is some Javascript towards the bottom of my index.html file as well.  
the registration form takes your login ID and password and a submit button to confirm user's input
If the user hasn't created a login Id, there is a registration option that asks for user's email, a unique username and password.
At the bottom of the registration form, the user is asked to check a box to agree to terms and conditions.
